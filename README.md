# Pyrobud

A selfbot for Telegram written in Python using Pyrogram.

**Python 3.6+** is required.
This was chosen because it makes development much easier, due to f-strings and typing.

# Installation
Simply run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This installs all the dependencies.

# Usage
Copy config.toml.sample to config.toml and edit it to your liking.
Obtain the API ID and hash from [Telegram's website](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
**KEEP THIS SECRET!**

To start the bot, type `python3 main.py`.
